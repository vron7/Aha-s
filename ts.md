# TS aha-s


```js
const number1 = 5;    // no need to explicitly assign a type here since TS will implicitly determine it by itself based on the value
let number2: number;  // let's assign a type here, because we do not initiate number2 with a value but we want it to be a number
let number3;          // any type since there is no value nor explicit type assigment 
```
