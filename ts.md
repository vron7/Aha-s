# TS aha-s

**Type assignments**
```js
// no need to explicitly assign a type here since TS will 
// implicitly determine it by itself based on the value
const number1 = 5;

// let's assign a type here, because we do not initiate number2 
// with a value but we want it to be a number
let number2: number; 

// any type since there is no value nor explicit type assigment 
let number3;          
```
