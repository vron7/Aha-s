Sir Tim Berners, british scientist, invented the **World Wide Web** in 1989  
Tim had written 3 fundamental technologies that remain foundation of todays web:  
1) **HTML** ( *HyperText Markup Language* ) - a textual format to represent hypertext documents
2) **URI** ( *Uniform Resource Identifier* ) - unique 'address' to identify each resource on the web
3) **HTTP** ( *HyperText Transfer Protocol* ) - protocol that enables featching of data(resources) on the web

**WorldWideWeb** - first web browser and editor, later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion with World Wide Web.
